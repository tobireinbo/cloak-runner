move physics to cannon-es

Alternative Idea:

inspiration: sludge life, splatoon, de blob

Multiplayer game (one for all or teams) where players compete by tagging walls with grafiti.
When Time runs out the player/team with the most tags wins.

Level are also vertical and require a lot of plattforming.
Try to gain as much velocity as possible to get from place to place faster than the other players
You can also stun other players for a short duration by throwing your can.
By throwing your can, you wont be able to spray for a short while if you miss the player, so be careful!


Simple Alternative:

Personal Website where people can spray walls and others will see who sprayed it by entered name
